# Automated-Purchase-and-Sale-Agreement-through-Ethereum
This is an automated purchase and sale agreement powered by smart contracts and Ethereum. In this app buyers and sellers are able to securely able to draw up contracts that only require the two parties. Once signed this contract is recorded onto a block and added to a chain. The purpose of this project is facilitate easier trade between individuals and provide a decentralized ledger of property history.

### Python Prototype
The end result for this project is to deploy a usable and scalable automated ledger system in the form of a smart contract to the Ethereum network. To help put this into perspective, included in the code is a python automated ledger prototype, to give a rough estimate of how the smart contract and ledger system will eventually work. The program will ask if the user would like to make a purchase. Then the seller and buyer would fill out the contract and sign it. This information would then get stored on a block and added to the ledger chain. This would create a secure and quick way to process transactions through two parties because the buyer will receive a copy of the ledger, including the transaction history, and the seller has proof of the transaction. This could potentially eliminate the need for a third party, for example notaries. This could also potentially be used by banks and other industries to track housing prices or other industry metrics.
